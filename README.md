Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

Project Overview
This project involves building an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyse customer churn within a telecom company. Since retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquisition, this dashboard addresses critical business questions regarding churn volume, plan performance, and customer behaviour. The final product is designed to mirror dashboards used by real-world analytics teams.

Technical Highlights

Designed for beginners, the project demonstrates how to:

• Transform Data: Load and clean data using Power Query.

• Visualise Insights: Create KPIs, interactive slicers, and standard business charts (bar, pie, and line).

• Apply DAX: Write and understand basic DAX measures to interpret business data.

• Design: Construct a clean and structured professional dashboard.
